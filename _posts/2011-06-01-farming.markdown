Ever since high school, I've wanted to be a farmer. Think of the appeal: everyday, you wake up early, work in the sun, and go to bed after a hard day's productive labor, cultivating delicious things. I love sun, I love food, and I love physical labor -- sounds like a dream job! Unfortunately, it's actually very difficult to make a sustainable living being a farmer. I lucked out in that I was given the opportunity to try my hand at it for a summer on a beautiful little farm on the Chesapeake Bay.
