Recycling can be pretty difficult. Each building or city or county has its own materials recovery facility (MRF), and each MRF has its own rules and capabilities when it comes to recycling. That's why my work with CleanRobotics has been so informative -- I've interviewed the Recycling Supervisor of the city of Pittsburgh and come away with so much insight into how recycling works at a much deeper level than I had before.

#### Operations

My role at CleanRobotics is the Director of Operations. What this means is that I basically fill in the cracks -- whatever isn't getting addressed, I recognize and address it. I analyze and implement new workflows in order to increase efficiency and help keep the company lean.

#### Marketing

In 1917 Elias acquired shares in the O-Zell jelly factory in Chicago and moved his family back to the city.[24] In the fall Disney began his freshman year at McKinley High School and took night courses at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts under the tutelage of artist and educator Louis Grell (1887–1960). He became the cartoonist for the school newspaper, drawing patriotic topics on World War I. With a hope to join the army, Disney dropped out of high school at the age of sixteen, but was rejected for being under-age.[26] Afterwards, Disney and a friend joined the Red Cross.[27] He was soon sent to France for a year, where he drove an ambulance, but only after the armistice was signed on November 11, 1918.

<p class="u--startsWithDoubleQuote">“Hoping to find work outside the Chicago O-Zell factory, Walt moved back to Kansas City in 1919 to begin his artistic career.” He considered becoming an actor, but decided to draw political caricatures or comic strips for a newspaper. When nobody wanted to hire him as either an artist or as an ambulance driver, his brother Roy, then working in a local bank, got Walt a temporary job through a bank colleague at the Pesmen-Rubin Art Studio, where he created advertisements for newspapers, magazines, and movie theaters. At Pesmen-Rubin he met cartoonist Ubbe Iwerks and, when their time at the studio expired, they decided to start their own commercial company together.</p>
